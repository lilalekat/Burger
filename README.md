    ___________
    <br>
    This app is all about eating burgers, yes, that's right! You'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and Sequelize as the ORM (yum!). This follows MVC design pattern and uses Node and MySQL to query and route data into the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

    Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

    <strong>How the App Works</strong>
    ___________
    <br>

    * Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be        devoured.

    * Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the        right side of the page.

    * The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
